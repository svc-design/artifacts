# Offline Flowise Installer

This archive contains container images and helper assets for deploying Flowise with Docker Compose.

## Contents
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Reference deployment manifest configured for the packaged images.
- `images/`: Pre-pulled container images saved as tar archives.
- `scripts/deploy-flowise.sh`: Helper script to load the images and manage the compose stack.

## Usage
1. Extract the archive on a host with Docker/nerdctl available.
2. (Optional) Run `IMAGE_LOAD_TOOL=nerdctl ./scripts/deploy-flowise.sh load-images` to import the images with nerdctl.
3. Start the stack: `./scripts/deploy-flowise.sh up`.
4. Access the Flowise UI at http://localhost:3000.

Adjust the compose file as needed before running the helper script.
